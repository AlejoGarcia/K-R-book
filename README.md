# K-R-book
Exercices and code from the C language book

## Organization

This repo is divided in chapters and in each chapter folder there are other two folders. One with the old version and other with the new. The new version es the supported one. The new version contains several files for the code exposed in each chapter (code) and for the excercises (ex). Names are created following the next pattern: chapter<chapternumber><type:ex or code><indexnumber>.c for example chapter5ex6.c. Secondary versions include a letter (b, c, d...) after the index number.
